				Graduate Student, University of Hawai&#699i at M&#257noa
			</h2>
			<p>
				As a PhD student I am researching game theoretic methods of controlling distributed networks.  As technology advances, networks of devices will only grow larger, and centralized control algorithms prove to be deficient in both robustness and computational tractability, we will lean towards more decentralized control.
			<p>
				Game theory is a rich topic thats uses have primarily been to describe the possible outcomes of complicated systems of self-interested agents.  From an engineering standpoint, I hope to turn game theory into a design tool that may provide definitive bounds on the efficiencies of distributed control laws.
